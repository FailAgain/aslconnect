DST 101 - Introduction to Deaf Studies (3)

This is an introductory survey to the field of Deaf Studies that highlights cutting edge concepts and theories at use in this field. The course will show how deaf people and sign languages are integral aspects of human diversity and how societies have responded to this diversity across different social, temporal, and cultural moments and movements. 3 credits. PST 210.

DST 203 - Introduction to Cultural Studies (3)

This course investigates how culture shapes the way people see the world. Students will explore cultural readings and examine various texts around us to understand how culture, identity and history frame experiences. Traditional courses in cultural studies assume that the meanings in this world are central in creating us -- individually and collectively. Students will examine how culture transmits a view of the world and power through critical analysis. PST 213.


DST 204 - Deaf Culture (3)

This course will begin with a macroscopic view of culture, and then will focus on the microscopic view of the Deaf experience. Multi-disciplinary approaches --- sociological, educational, linguistic, psychological and humanistic -- will be taken to study important persons, historical events and diversity within the global Deaf community. PST 212.


DST 311 - Dynamics of Oppression (3)

This course examines various forms of oppression by looking across different cultures and communities, then examines possible parallels occurring within the deaf community. PST 202.


DST 314 - Oral Traditions in the Deaf Community (3)

The dynamics of oral cultures and their traditions will be introduced in this course by studying the development of oral literature and literary artists in other cultures. Then using this as background, attempts will be made to study ASL literary tradition by looking at life histories, narratives, and poetry performances. PST 203.



DST 316 - Disability Studies (3)

This course will introduce students to the field of Disability Studies. As an emerging interdisciplinary field of study, Disability Studies does not approach disability as a "medical condition, but as a human condition" (Charlton). Instead of studying the causes and rehabilitation of persons with disabilities, we will explore the historical, social, political, religious, philosophical, and cultural influences that "construct" the category of "disability." We will also examine how persons with disabilities construct their own meanings and identities. PST 260.


DST 402 - Deaf Women's Studies (3)

This course will explore how the field of women's studies came into being by way of the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention. Issues faced by both hearing and deaf women will be investigated: career, educational opportunities, reproduction, and patriarchy, among others. PST 222.


DST 410 - Multicultural Deaf Lives (Topic to be specified) (3)

This course will focus on cultural issues, values, behaviors, identities and language of Deaf people from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds. Students will examine autobiographies, documentaries, films, videos, and academic literature to help understand the contributions and historical development of the emerging majority of the Deaf community that is underrepresented in the United States and the world. Course may be repeated as topics change. PST 229.
