1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
... support
more desk hours outside

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
traditional office hours.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
...now we have 24
hours coverage in ELY?

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
ELY and Krug?

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What about giving the males
equal treatment

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with the females?

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Not only on duty overnight
but as well as them?

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
...Before it was not...

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So that is increased
executive duty hours

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to keep the desks open.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yes, we give opportunities,

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but we can't just create jobs
to please the students.

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We can't do it...

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
... I believe that the students

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
have better relationship
with some,

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I mean, for example,
there are issues

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with communication with the
full-time counselors now.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They cannot sign well-and
they work full-time,

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and they interpret what
we say, and it is frustrating.

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The students are up at nights

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and they talk with the
counselors.

22
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
They talk to our doctors,
and express our problems,

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and they are
supervisors now.

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000
SBG on that and I get my leave
on Thursday afternoon...

25
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:57.000
...answer but
the counselors refuse to answer.

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
for next January...

27
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
for that discussion.

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Oh.

29
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We can't do that now...

30
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
November 2.

31
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Okay, I'll tell him later.

32
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Yes.. myself..
